I have no idea why it works but it works :-) Basically a modified version of the to-do list app in the Docker's tutorial.

## write.html
On this page users can add messages to the whiteboard.
## display.html
This is the page where users visualise the anonymous messages.
## admin.html
This is an admin page that I use to delete the inappropriate messages.
## setup
I usually run the docker image on my raspberry pi, hosting the web app locally. In this way, only participants to the party (that of course have access to the local network) can write on the whiteboard. My "whiteboard" is a smart television.
